# Bevacizumab (Avastin) Protocols for Glioblastoma

## FDA-Approved Indication
- **Approved for**: Recurrent glioblastoma in adults
- **Status for newly diagnosed GBM**: Not recommended as standard addition to Stupp protocol

## Current Dosing Regimens

### Standard Dosing
- **Monotherapy**: 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks
- **Alternative monotherapy**: 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks
- **Combination therapy**: 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (with TMZ)

### Clinical Practice Variations (2024 Data)
- **Low dose**: 5 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks
- **High dose**: 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks
- **Choice**: At clinician's discretion
- **Usage**: 85% of patients receive as monotherapy

## Treatment Protocols

### Newly Diagnosed GBM (Investigational - Not Standard)
#### Concomitant Phase (6 weeks)
- **Bevacizumab**: 10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 15
- **Temozolomide**: 75 mg/m² PO daily
- **Radiation**: 2 Gy/day, 5 days/week (60 Gy total)

#### Maintenance Phase (6 cycles)
- **Bevacizumab**: 10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 15 (every 28 days)
- **Temozolomide**: 150-200 mg/m² PO days 1-5
- **Extension option**: Up to 12 cycles

#### Monotherapy Phase
- **Bevacizumab**: 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks
- **Continue**: Until progression or toxicity

### Recurrent GBM (FDA-Approved)
- **Standard**: 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks
- **Duration**: Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
- **Combination**: May be used with TMZ or as monotherapy

## Administration Guidelines

### Infusion Protocol
- **First infusion**: Over 90 minutes
- **Subsequent infusions**: Over 60 minutes (if well tolerated)
- **Further reduction**: Over 30 minutes (if previous infusions tolerated)
- **Route**: IV infusion only (never IV push or bolus)

### Pre-medication
- **Not routinely required**
- **Consider**: For patients with history of infusion reactions
- **Antihistamine/corticosteroid**: As per institutional protocol

## Safety Monitoring and Contraindications

### Key Safety Parameters
- **Blood pressure**: Monitor before each dose and regularly during treatment
- **Proteinuria**: Baseline and regular monitoring
- **Wound healing**: Assessment before elective surgery
- **Bleeding risk**: Evaluate for active bleeding

### Major Adverse Events (GBM-Specific Data)
- **Arterial thromboembolic events**: Grade ≥3 in 5% of GBM patients
- **Hypertension**: Common, manage with antihypertensives
- **Proteinuria**: Monitor urine protein regularly
- **CNS hemorrhage**: Risk in GBM patients

### Contraindications
- **Recent major surgery**: Within 28 days
- **Active bleeding**
- **Uncontrolled hypertension**
- **Recent arterial thromboembolic event**

## Dose Modifications

### Key Principle
- **No dose reductions recommended** per FDA labeling
- **Management**: Hold treatment for toxicity, resume at same dose
- **Discontinue**: For severe or persistent toxicities

### Common Scenarios
- **Hypertension**: Optimize antihypertensive therapy, hold if severe
- **Proteinuria**: Hold for ≥2g/24hr, resume when <2g/24hr
- **Bleeding**: Permanently discontinue for Grade 3-4 bleeding
- **Arterial thrombosis**: Permanently discontinue

## Clinical Evidence Summary

### Newly Diagnosed GBM
- **PFS benefit**: Demonstrated in Phase III trials
- **OS benefit**: No significant improvement shown
- **Current recommendation**: Not standard of care for newly diagnosed

### Recurrent GBM
- **FDA approved**: Based on response rate and PFS
- **Monotherapy efficacy**: Established
- **Combination therapy**: Used in clinical practice

## 2024 Clinical Practice Patterns

### Usage Distribution
- **Monotherapy**: 85% of treatments
- **Combination**: 15% (typically with TMZ)
- **Setting**: Primarily recurrent disease

### Dosing Preferences
- **Physician discretion**: Between 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg q2wk
- **Institutional protocols**: Vary significantly
- **Patient factors**: Performance status, comorbidities influence choice

## Special Considerations

### Surgery Planning
- **Pre-operative**: Stop 6-8 weeks before elective surgery
- **Post-operative**: Resume ≥28 days after surgery (wound healing complete)
- **Emergency surgery**: Case-by-case assessment

### Combination with Other Agents
- **TMZ**: Most common combination
- **Other cytotoxics**: Limited data
- **Immunotherapy**: Under investigation
- **Radiation**: Concurrent use studied

## Economic Considerations
- **Cost**: Significant financial burden
- **Duration**: Long-term treatment until progression
- **Monitoring**: Frequent visits and assessments required
