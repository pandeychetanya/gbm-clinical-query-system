## GLIOBLASTOMA & GLIOMA TREATMENT UPDATES

### GLIO-7: Glioblastoma MGMT Status Decision
**CRITICAL CHANGE**: 
- **Indeterminate MGMT status** → **Treat as MGMT promoter methylated**
- **Clinical Impact**: Committee favors temozolomide use when MGMT status uncertain
- **Rationale**: Risk-benefit analysis favors treatment over observation

### GLIO-3: IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma Treatment Protocol
**NEW TREATMENT ALGORITHM**:

**Grade 3 IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma** (Based on CATNON Study):
1. **Radiation therapy** (standard dose)
2. **Followed by**: 12 months adjuvant temozolomide
3. **Evidence**: EORTC study 26053-22054 second interim analysis

**Grade 4 IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma**:
- **Options include**: Grade 3 protocols plus additional treatments
- **Separated guidelines**: High-grade IDH-mutant now have dedicated protocols

### GLIO-9: H3-Mutated High-Grade Glioma
**NEW MOLECULAR CATEGORY**:
- **Separate algorithm** created for H3-mutated tumors
- **Clinical characteristics**:
  - More aggressive behavior than standard glioblastoma
  - **Less sensitive to temozolomide**
  - Located in midline structures (thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord)

**Treatment Approach**:
- **Current recommendation**: Same options as glioblastoma
- **Rationale**: Lack of other effective therapies
- **Research need**: H3-mutant specific clinical trials

### GLIO-1: Adult Circumscribed Glioma
**REORGANIZATION**:
- **New category**: "Adult Glioma: Circumscribed Glioma"
- **Includes**:
  - Pilocytic astrocytoma
  - Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma  
  - Ganglioglioma
  - Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma WHO grade 2

## RADIATION THERAPY UPDATES (BRAIN-C)

### Low-Grade Glioma Dose Escalation
**AGGRESSIVE HISTOLOGY MANAGEMENT**:
- **Standard dose**: 50.4-54 Gy
- **Dose escalation to 59.4-60 Gy** for:
  - IDH wild-type diffuse low-grade glioma
  - CDKN2A/B deleted, IDH-mutated low-grade glioma
- **Rationale**: These patients have more aggressive disease course
- **Treatment approach**: Treat as high-grade glioma

### Re-irradiation Protocol Updates
**ENHANCED GUIDELINES**:
- **Target volume delineation**: Specific recommendations
- **Suggested RT doses**: Evidence-based dose recommendations
- **Focal RT techniques**: Multiple technique options
- **Image-guided RT**: Role in recurrent low-grade gliomas
- **Clinical context**: More specific treatment scenarios

### Meningioma Treatment Updates
**WHO Grade 2 Meningiomas**:
- **Higher RT doses**: 59.4-60 Gy (previously lower)
- **Indications**:
  - Subtotally resected disease
  - Recurrent tumors
- **Evidence basis**: Improved local control with higher doses

### Brain Metastases Management
**STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY (SRS)**:
- **Fractionated SRS**: Additional recommendations for use
- **Preoperative SRS**: Category 2B recommendation
  - Consider when logistically feasible
  - May reduce post-treatment meningeal recurrence risk
- **Postoperative SRS**: 
  - Multifraction approach for larger surgical cavities
  - Specific dose and fractionation recommendations

**WHOLE-BRAIN RADIATION**:
- **Cognitive sparing techniques**: Specific recommendations
- **Indications**: Clarified criteria
- **Dose and fractionation**: Updated recommendations

## MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY UPDATES (BRAIN-E)

### Essential Molecular Testing Panel
**HIGH-YIELD MOLECULAR ALTERATIONS**:

**Mutations (Essential)**:
- **IDH1 R132** (most common IDH mutation)
- **IDH2 R172** (less common IDH mutation)
- **TERT promoter** (telomerase reverse transcriptase)
- **ATRX** (alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked)
- **EGFR** (epidermal growth factor receptor)
- **BRAF V600E** (B-Raf proto-oncogene)
- **H3-3A mutations**: K27 or G34 (histone H3.3)

**Copy Number Alterations (Essential)**:
- **1p19q codeletion** (oligodendroglioma marker)
- **EGFR amplification** (glioblastoma marker)
- **Chromosome 7 gain** (glioblastoma marker)
- **Chromosome 10 loss** (glioblastoma marker)
- **CDKN2A/B deletion** (aggressive disease marker)

### Advanced Molecular Diagnostics
**COMPLEX CASES**:
- **Equivocal histopathology + molecular**: Refer to specialized centers
- **Advanced techniques**: Genomic DNA methylation profiling
- **Expert consultation**: Centers with molecular diagnostic expertise

**THERAPEUTIC IMPACT**:
- **Driver mutation discovery**: Potential therapeutic targets
- **Panel support**: Encourages comprehensive molecular testing
- **Community coverage**: Testing panel covers majority of primary gliomas

## CLINICAL MANAGEMENT UPDATES (BRAIN-D)

### Corticosteroid Management
**DEXAMETHASONE DOSING**:
- **Specific recommendation**: Twice daily OR once daily dosing
- **Evidence basis**: Optimized symptom control with reduced side effects
- **Reference study**: Lim-Fat MJ et al., Neurosurgery 2019

## KEY CLINICAL TRIALS REFERENCED

### CATNON Study (EORTC 26053-22054)
**Citation**: van den Bent MJ, Tesileanu CMS, Wick W, et al. Lancet Oncol. 2021;22(6):813-823.

**Study Design**: Phase 3, randomized, open-label
**Population**: 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic glioma (Grade 3 IDH-mutant)
**Intervention**: Adjuvant and concurrent temozolomide
**Key Finding**: RT + 12 months adjuvant TMZ improves outcomes

**Citation**: Appay R, Dehais C, Maurage CA, et al. Neuro Oncol. 2019;21(12):1519-1528.

**Key Finding**: CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion = strong adverse prognostic factor
**Clinical Impact**: These tumors should be treated more aggressively
**Treatment implication**: Consider high-grade glioma protocols

## CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHMS

### MGMT Testing Decision Tree
```
MGMT Promoter Status Assessment
├── Methylated → Temozolomide favored
├── Unmethylated → Consider temozolomide vs alternatives  
└── Indeterminate → **NEW: Treat as methylated** (favor TMZ)
```

### IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma Treatment
```
IDH-Mutant Astrocytoma
├── Grade 2 → Observation vs RT ± chemotherapy
├── Grade 3 → RT + 12 months adjuvant TMZ (CATNON protocol)
└── Grade 4 → Grade 3 options + additional treatments
```

### H3-Mutant Glioma Management  
```
H3-Mutant High-Grade Glioma
├── K27M mutation → Less TMZ-sensitive, consider alternatives
├── G34 mutation → Less TMZ-sensitive, consider alternatives
└── Current treatment → Same as GBM (lack of specific therapies)
```
