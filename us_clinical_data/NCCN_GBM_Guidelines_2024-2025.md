# NCCN Guidelines for Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) - 2024-2025

## Standard Treatment Recommendations

### First-Line Treatment (Category 1)
**For patients ≤70 years with good PS (KPS ≥60), regardless of MGMT methylation status:**
- Fractionated standard brain radiation therapy (RT) 
- Plus concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ)
- With or without alternating electric field therapy

### MGMT Status Considerations
- **MGMT promoter methylated GBM**: Temozolomide is recommended
- **Indeterminate MGMT status**: Committee favors use of temozolomide
- **H3-mutated high-grade gliomas**: Tend to be less sensitive to temozolomide

## Temozolomide Dosing Protocol (Stupp Regimen)

### Concomitant Phase (6 weeks)
- **Temozolomide**: 75 mg/m² PO daily for 42-49 consecutive days
- **Radiation**: 2 Gy/day, 5 days/week (maximum 60 Gy total)

### Maintenance Phase (6 cycles, every 28 days)
- **Cycle 1**: 150 mg/m² PO daily for 5 days
- **Cycles 2-6**: May increase to 200 mg/m² daily for 5 days if tolerated
- Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

### Administration Guidelines
- Take on empty stomach with glass of water
- Dose should be multiple of 5 mg
- Available capsules: 5, 20, 100, 140, 180, 250 mg
- Prophylactic antiemetics recommended

### Prerequisites for Dosing
- ANC ≥1.5 × 10⁹/L
- Platelet count ≥100 × 10⁹/L
- Weekly CBC monitoring during concomitant phase

## Bevacizumab (Avastin) Guidelines

### Current Recommendations
- **Newly diagnosed GBM**: NOT recommended as addition to standard Stupp protocol
- **Recurrent GBM**: FDA-approved, used as monotherapy or with temozolomide

### Dosing Regimens
- **Standard**: 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks
- **Alternative**: 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks (monotherapy)
- **Clinical practice variations**: 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks

### Evidence Summary
- Improves progression-free survival
- NO significant improvement in overall survival for newly diagnosed GBM
- Remains option for recurrent disease

## Treatment Outcomes
- **Median PFS**: ~7 months
- **Median OS**: 14-16 months with standard Stupp regimen
- **Extended treatment**: Some evidence supports >6 cycles maintenance TMZ

## Key Safety Monitoring
- Blood counts (weekly during RT phase)
- Blood pressure (for bevacizumab)
- Arterial thromboembolic events (Grade ≥3: 5% with GBM)
- No dose reductions recommended for bevacizumab

## Current Research Trends (2024)
- Extended adjuvant TMZ (>6 cycles) showing promise
- 12 cycles vs 6 cycles: improved OS (22.8 vs 17.5 months)
- Dose-dense schedules under investigation
- Molecular classification driving treatment selection
