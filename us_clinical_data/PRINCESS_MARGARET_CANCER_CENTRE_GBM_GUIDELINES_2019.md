## EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CLINICAL FEATURES

### Glioblastoma Incidence in Canada
- **Most common glioma** in adults
- **Annual incidence**: 3/100,000 per year (general population)
- **Elderly incidence**: 12-14/100,000 in patients >65 years
- **Median age**: Gradually increasing, now **65 years**
- **Age trend**: Increasing incidence with advancing age

### Clinical Presentation
- **Imaging characteristics**: Irregular enhancing necrotic mass with mass effect and edema
- **WHO 2007 classification**: Grade IV glioblastoma, secondary glioblastoma, small cell glioblastoma

---

## MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS AND BIOMARKERS

### MGMT Promoter Methylation Status
- **Prognostic significance**: Found to be prognostic and predictive factor in research studies
- **Clinical impact**: Associated with improved survival and higher likelihood of **temozolomide** benefit
- **Prevalence**: Present in **25-45%** of newly diagnosed patients
- **Testing limitation**: No reliable commercially available test currently available for determination

### Key Molecular Alterations
- **LOH chromosome 10q**: Most frequent alteration (60-90% of cases)
- **p53 gene deletion**: 25-40% of glioblastomas (more common in secondary GBM, younger patients)
- **EGFR overexpression**: 30-50% of primary GBM (associated with LOH 10q)
- **EGFRvIII variant**: Target for kinase inhibitors, immunotoxins, peptide vaccines
- **PDGFR amplification**: 60% in secondary glioblastoma pathway
- **PTEN mutations**: Up to 30% of glioblastomas
- **IDH1 mutation**: 5-10% of GBM (favorable prognosis, indicates secondary GBM)

## AGE-STRATIFIED TREATMENT PROTOCOLS

### Patients <70 Years Old
**Standard of Care Protocol**:
1. **Maximal safe surgical resection**
2. **Concurrent chemoradiotherapy**:
   - **Radiotherapy**: 60 Gy in 30 fractions (6 weeks)
   - **Concurrent temozolomide**: 75 mg/m² daily during radiotherapy
3. **Adjuvant chemotherapy**:
   - **Temozolomide**: 150-200 mg/m² for 5 days every 28 days
   - **Duration**: 6-12 months (6-12 cycles)

### Patients ≥70 Years Old
**Elderly-Specific Protocol**:
1. **Maximal safe surgical resection**
2. **Hypofractionated concurrent chemoradiotherapy**:
   - **Radiotherapy**: 40 Gy in 15 fractions (3 weeks)
   - **Concurrent temozolomide**: 75 mg/m² daily during radiotherapy
3. **Adjuvant chemotherapy**:
   - **Temozolomide**: 150-200 mg/m² for 5 days every 28 days
   - **Duration**: 6-12 months

### Alternative Elderly Treatment Options
**For patients ≥70 years with specific considerations**:
- **Temozolomide monotherapy**: Equivalent to radiotherapy (54-60 Gy/30 fractions or 34 Gy/10 fractions)
- **Short-course radiotherapy**: 25 Gy in 5 fractions option
- **MGMT hypermethylated tumors**: Temozolomide monotherapy as initial treatment for patients unfit for radiotherapy

## RADIOTHERAPY SPECIFICATIONS

### Standard Radiotherapy Protocol (<70 years)
- **Immobilization**: Thermoplastic mask
- **Imaging**: CT, MRI FLAIR, T1 with gadolinium
- **Technique**: IMRT (Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy)
- **Dose**: 60 Gy in 30 fractions
- **Large volume option**: 54 Gy/30 fractions ± simultaneous integrated boost

### Target Volume Definition
#### Primary Glioblastoma
- **GTV**: Surgical cavity + enhancing tumor
- **CTV**: 15mm expansion
- **PTV**: 3mm expansion

#### Secondary Glioblastoma
- **GTV**: FLAIR abnormality
- **CTV**: 10mm expansion

- **25 Gy in 5 fractions**
- **20 Gy in 5 fractions** (partial brain)
- **30 Gy in 10 fractions** (whole brain)

---

## PSEUDOPROGRESSION MANAGEMENT

### Clinical Challenge
- **Pseudoprogression incidence**: 25-30% of patients on first post-RT/TMZ MRI (1 month)
- **True progression incidence**: ~25% of patients at 1 month
- **Combined prevalence**: ~50% of patients show possible progression at 1 month

### Diagnostic Limitations
- **MR spectroscopy, perfusion, diffusion**: Can distinguish in 60-70% of cases
- **Clinical limitation**: Not reliable enough for individual patient determination

### Management Strategy
**For patients with possible progression at 1 month post-RT/TMZ**:
1. **If patient remains well**: Start adjuvant **temozolomide**
2. **Continue treatment**: For 3 months
3. **Reassess at 3 months**: Next MRI typically clarifies true situation
4. **Rationale**: Allows differentiation between pseudoprogression and true progression

## SURGICAL MANAGEMENT

### Primary Surgery
- **Goal**: Maximal safe resection in all feasible cases
- **Factors considered**: Tumor location, patient medical condition
- **Evidence**: Studies demonstrate improved survival with gross total resection > partial resection > biopsy
- **Evidence quality**: No Class I data exists

### Recurrent Disease Surgery
- **Indication**: Useful approach when mass effect is present
- **Goal**: Symptom palliation and cytoreduction

---

## MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE APPROACH

### Tumor Board Review
**Team composition**:
- Neurosurgery
- Radiation Oncology
- Neuro-Oncology
- Neuropathology
- Neuroradiology

**Timing**: Pre-operative (occasionally) and post-operative (routine) once pathology available

### Clinical Trial Integration
- **Recommendation**: Patients encouraged to enter experimental Phase I/II studies
- **Priority**: New agent trials for eligible patients

---

## SPECIALIZED PATIENT POPULATIONS

### Gliomatosis Cerebri
- **Initial approach**: **Temozolomide** monotherapy
- **Radiotherapy timing**: Delayed until progression in patients well enough for continued therapy
- **RT options**: Partial or whole brain RT 54 Gy in 30 fractions

### Poor Performance Status Patients
- **No radiation recommended**: Bedridden and confused patients despite optimal surgery and dexamethasone
