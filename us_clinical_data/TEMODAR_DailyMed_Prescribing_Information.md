## WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

### Myelosuppression
- Monitor blood counts weekly during concomitant phase
- Monitor blood counts on day 22 and day 29 of each maintenance cycle
- May cause thrombocytopenia and neutropenia

### Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP) Prophylaxis
- Provide PCP prophylaxis during concomitant treatment phase
- Continue prophylaxis in patients who develop lymphocytopenia until lymphocyte count recovers to Grade 1 or less

### Secondary Malignancies
- Risk of secondary cancers with long-term use
- Monitor patients for development of secondary malignancies

### Hepatotoxicity
- Monitor liver function tests
- Cases of severe hepatotoxicity have been reported

### Embryo-Fetal Toxicity
- Can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women
- Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception

## ADVERSE REACTIONS

### Most Common Adverse Reactions (≥20%)
- Alopecia (hair loss)
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Headache
- Constipation

### Serious Adverse Reactions
- Myelosuppression (decreased blood cell counts)
- Hepatotoxicity
- Secondary malignancies
- Potential convulsions

## MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

### Concomitant Phase
- Weekly complete blood count (CBC)
- Weekly assessment of toxicity
- Monitor for signs of infection

### Maintenance Phase
- CBC on day 1 and day 22 of each cycle
- Monitor for delayed toxicities
- Assess performance status

## DOSE MODIFICATIONS

### Prerequisites for Dosing
- ANC ≥1.5 × 10⁹/L
- Platelet count ≥100 × 10⁹/L
- Non-hematological toxicity ≤ Grade 1 (except alopecia, nausea, vomiting)

### Concomitant Phase
- No dose reductions recommended
- Dose interruptions may occur based on patient tolerance

### Maintenance Phase
- Dose may be reduced for toxicity
- Consider permanent discontinuation if unable to tolerate treatment

## CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

### Mechanism of Action
- DNA alkylating agent
- Undergoes rapid nonenzymatic conversion to the active compound MTIC
- MTIC methylates DNA at several sites

### Pharmacokinetics
- Rapid and complete absorption after oral administration
- Crosses blood-brain barrier
- Eliminated primarily by renal excretion

## CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of TEMODAR was established in a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial comparing radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant TEMODAR to radiotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

### Study Results
- Treatment with TEMODAR plus radiotherapy demonstrated significant improvement in overall survival
- Median survival improved compared to radiotherapy alone
- Primary endpoint of overall survival was achieved

## STORAGE AND HANDLING
- Store capsules at controlled room temperature
- Keep container tightly closed
- Protect from moisture
