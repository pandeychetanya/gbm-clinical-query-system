## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive review compares practical guidelines for gliomas published by three major neuro-oncology organizations:

## DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINES COMPARISON

### Essential Molecular Testing Requirements

|-----------|------|------|------|
| **IDH mutation test** | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential |
| **1p/19q codeletion** | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential |
| **ATRX mutation** | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential |
| **MGMT promoter methylation** | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential | ✓ Essential |
| **TERT promoter mutation** | Consider for GBM features | Additional testing | ✓ Essential |
| **EGFR amplification** | Consider for GBM features | Additional testing | ✓ Essential |

### Key Diagnostic Differences
- **EANO**: Most comprehensive molecular testing requirements
- **NCCN**: Emphasizes clinical trial molecular testing (NTRK, BRAF V600E, mTOR)
- **KSNO**: Focuses on essential markers with consideration of GBM molecular features

- **MGMT unmethylated**: CCRT + adjuvant **temozolomide** ± alternating electrical field therapy OR radiotherapy alone
- **Strong emphasis on clinical trial enrollment**

**EANO Protocol**:
- Standard Stupp regimen (CCRT + adjuvant **temozolomide**) for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma
- Age <70 years and KPS >70

- CCRT + adjuvant **temozolomide**
- Hypofractionated RT alone

**NCCN Protocol**:

- **MGMT unmethylated**: CCRT + adjuvant **temozolomide** ± TTF

**EANO Protocol**:
- **MGMT unmethylated**: RT alone (40 Gy in 2.67 Gy fractions)
- **MGMT methylated**: **Temozolomide** CCRT or **temozolomide** alone

## GRADE 3 GLIOMA TREATMENT PROTOCOLS

### Anaplastic Astrocytoma, IDH-Mutant

**KSNO Options**:
1. Standard RT + adjuvant **temozolomide** chemotherapy
2. Standard RT + concurrent/adjuvant **temozolomide**
3. Standard RT + neoadjuvant/adjuvant PCV chemotherapy
4. Standard RT alone

**NCCN Protocol** (Performance Status Dependent):
- **KPS ≥60**: Standard RT + adjuvant **temozolomide** OR RT + concurrent/adjuvant **temozolomide** (12 cycles)
- **KPS <60**: Hypofractionated RT, **temozolomide** alone, or supportive care

**EANO Protocol**:
- Standard RT (54-60 Gy) + **temozolomide** OR PCV chemotherapy
- **Role of concurrent temozolomide uncertain**

### Anaplastic Astrocytoma, IDH-Wildtype

**KSNO**: Same protocol as WHO Grade 4 glioblastoma
**NCCN**: Same protocol for all anaplastic astrocytomas regardless of IDH status
**EANO**: RT or CCRT with **temozolomide** based on MGMT methylation status

---

## RECURRENT/PROGRESSIVE GLIOMA SALVAGE THERAPY

### KSNO Recommendations for Recurrent GBM
**Systemic Chemotherapy Options**:
1. **Bevacizumab alone**
2. **Bevacizumab plus irinotecan**
3. Daily low-dose **temozolomide**
4. Lomustine or carmustine
5. PCV or procarbazine plus lomustine

### NCCN Recommendations for Recurrent GBM
**Primary Approach**: Clinical trial enrollment (preferred)
**Systemic Treatment Options**:
1. **Bevacizumab** (single or combination with carmustine, lomustine, or **temozolomide**)
2. **Temozolomide** chemotherapy
3. Lomustine or carmustine
4. PCV chemotherapy

### EANO Recommendations for Recurrent GBM
**Systemic Treatment Options**:
1. Nitrosoureas
2. **Temozolomide** rechallenge
3. **Bevacizumab** (depending on availability)

**Critical Note**: **Bevacizumab is NOT approved for recurrent glioblastoma in the European Union**, although approved in other countries based on single-arm studies showing radiographic response rates.

## PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT CONSIDERATIONS

### Korean Healthcare System Specific Factors:
- **Health insurance coverage limitations**: No coverage for alternating electric field therapy
- **Limited clinical trial infrastructure**: Cultural and commercial barriers
- **Standardized approach**: Less MGMT methylation stratification compared to Western guidelines

### US Healthcare System (NCCN):
- **Strong clinical trial emphasis**: Preferred first-line approach
- **Technology access**: TTF therapy integration
- **Precision medicine approach**: Extensive molecular testing for targeted therapy

### European Healthcare System (EANO):
- **Regulatory constraints**: Bevacizumab not approved for recurrent GBM
- **Comprehensive molecular testing**: Most extensive biomarker requirements
- **Evidence-based stratification**: Strong MGMT methylation-based protocols

## CLINICAL RESEARCH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED

### Areas Requiring Further Investigation:
1. **Age cutoff standardization**: 65-70 vs 70 years for elderly classification
2. **MGMT methylation clinical utility**: Uniform vs stratified approaches
3. **Bevacizumab efficacy**: Regional approval discrepancies
4. **Performance status thresholds**: KPS 60 vs 70 cutoffs
5. **Molecular testing cost-effectiveness**: Comprehensive vs targeted panels

### Recommendations for Future Guidelines:
1. **Multi-institutional retrospective studies** to establish meaningful prognostic age cutoffs
2. **International cooperation** in neuro-oncology societies to harmonize approaches
3. **Real-world evidence collection** on molecular testing implementation
4. **Health economics research** on guideline adherence and outcomes

| **Elderly GBM, MGMT-** | Hypofractionated RT + TMZ | Stupp ± TTF | RT alone (40 Gy) |
| **Recurrent GBM** | Bevacizumab ± combinations | Clinical trial → Bevacizumab | TMZ rechallenge, limited bevacizumab |

| **Clinical Trial Priority** | Standard care first | Clinical trial preferred | Evidence-based selection |

**Abbreviations**: TMZ = Temozolomide, AA3 = Anaplastic Astrocytoma Grade 3, TTF = Tumor Treating Fields, CCRT = Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy

This comparative analysis reveals significant international variations in glioma management, particularly regarding **temozolomide dosing strategies**, **bevacizumab utilization**, and **molecular testing implementation**. These differences reflect varying healthcare systems, regulatory environments, and clinical trial infrastructure across Korea, the United States, and Europe.
