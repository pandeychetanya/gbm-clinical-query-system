- **Cycle 1**: 150 mg/m² once daily for 5 days followed by 23 days without treatment
- **Cycles 2-6**: Dose may be escalated to 200 mg/m² if tolerated

### 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

#### 5.1 Myelosuppression
- Patients may experience myelosuppression, including prolonged pancytopenia
- May result in aplastic anemia (sometimes fatal)
- Higher risk in geriatric patients and women
- Monitor ANC ≥1.5 × 10⁹/L and platelets ≥100 × 10⁹/L before dosing

#### 5.2 Myelodysplastic Syndrome
Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary malignancies, including myeloid leukemia, have been observed.

#### 5.3 Pneumocystis Pneumonia
- Prophylaxis required for all patients receiving concomitant TEMODAR and radiotherapy
- Higher occurrence possible with longer dosing regimens
- Monitor all patients closely, especially those receiving steroids

#### 5.4 Laboratory Tests
